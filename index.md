### Researches

+ Chao Gao, Siqi Yan, Ryan Hayward, Martin Mueller. [A transferable neural network for Hex](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/ps/2018/2018-cg-transferable-network.pdf) CG2018. **At 21st Computer Olympiad, our program MoHex3HNN based on three-head net and transfer learning (128 filters per layer, 10 residual blocks, iteratively trained on ~0.4 million self-play generated games) won 11x11 and 13x13 Hex tournaments against DeepEzo from Japan.** DeepEzo was trained using minimax search based RL for several millions of games. Note that in comparison to MoHex3HNN and DeepEzo, previous champion program MoHex 2.0 is now a weak baseline. See report [Hex 2018: MoHex3HNN over DeepEzo](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/papers/taiwan18.pdf)
