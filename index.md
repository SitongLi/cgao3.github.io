### **Biography**
I am currently a Master student at [Department of Computing Science, Western University](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/), and I will graduate in Sep. 2019.

I was majoring in Neuroscience prior transferring to Computer Science at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

### **Skills and Other**
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, Matlab, R, SQL.
- **Tools**: Apache Hadoop, MongoDB, Kiabana, SPSS, Adode Illustrator, Origin.
- **Interests**: Algorithm, Running.
- **Mathematics**: Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Stochastic Process.

### **Project Experience**
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview/)
   - Applied series of data cleaning, visualization, model selection and ensembling.
   - Achieved top 7% out of all participants. 
- [Learn Same-Different Visual Relation through Prior Knowledge](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/svrt/)
   - Constructed a transfer learning model with pre-trained VGG-16, which only achieved chance-level predictive performance on new tasks.
   - Combined the pre-trained VGG model and a prossesive retraining process together, achieving performance comparable to human's performance.   
- [Twitter sentimental analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/twitter-sentiment-analysis2/overview)
   - Constructed a series of machine learning models (naive bayes, maximum entropy, random forest, SVM, etc.), trained and tested them on twitter dataset.
