### **Biography**
I am currently a Master student at [Department of Computing Science, Western University](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/), and I will graduate in Sep. 2019.

I was majoring in Neuroscience prior transferring to Computer Science at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

### **Skills and Other**
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, Matlab, R, SQL.
- **Tools**: Apache Hadoop, MongoDB, Kiabana, SPSS, Adode Illustrator, Origin.
- **Interests**: Algorithm, Running.
- **Mathematics**: Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Stochastic Process.

### **Project Experience**
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview/)
   - Applied series of data cleaning, visualization, model selection and ensembling.
   - Achieved top 7% out of all participants.
- [Word-level Inverted Index Development for Text Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index)
   - Developed a set of programs applying inverted index for a set of documents and supporting various search queries.
   - Created inverted index using [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) to support Boolean search queries.  
- [Learn Same-Different Visual Relation through Prior Knowledge](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/svrt/)
   - Constructed a transfer learning model with pre-trained VGG-16, which only achieved chance-level predictive performance on new tasks.
   - Combined the pre-trained VGG model and a prossesive retraining process together, achieving performance comparable to human's performance.   
- [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/home)
   - Constructed a self defined CNN and also adopted a pre-trained resnet-50, trained and tested them on Fashion MNIST dataset.
- [Twitter sentimental analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/twitter-sentiment-analysis2/overview)
   - Constructed a series of machine learning models (naive bayes, maximum entropy, random forest, SVM, etc.), trained and tested them on twitter dataset.
