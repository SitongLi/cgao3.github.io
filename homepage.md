### Biography
I am a PhD student at the Department of Computing Science, co-supervised by [Prof. Martin Mueller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/) and [Prof. Ryan Hayward](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/). 

I received my M.S. degree in 2015 from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn), where I worked at [USTC-Birming Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications](http://ubri.ustc.edu.cn/).


### Research 
I have a wide interest in all aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research.  
I am currently a part-time research intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/en/) at Edmonton.

	+ Chao Gao, Siqi Yan, Ryan Hayward, Martin Mueller. [A transferable neural network for Hex](#) 
	In Computer Games 2018. **At 21st Computer Olympiad, our program MoHex3HNN based on three-head net and transfer learning (128 filters per layer, 10 residual blocks, iteratively trained on ~0.4 million self-play generated games) won 11x11 and 13x13 Hex tournaments against DeepEzo from Japan. DeepEzo was trained using minimax search based RL for several millions of games. Note that in comparison to MoHex3HNN and DeepEzo, previous champion program MoHex 2.0 is now a weak baseline.** See report [Hex 2018: MoHex3HNN over DeepEzo](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/papers/taiwan18.pdf)

European Journal of Operational Research, 260.1 (2017): 1-11. A family of pseudo-cuts are proposed with a novel concept of pseudo-gap. The derived iterative algorithm becomes the-state-of-art approach for solving MMKPs.

European Journal of Operational Research, 246.3 (2015): 750-761. A simple stochastic local search algorithm is proposed which has similar or even better performance with the best existing algorithm (3-flip search based Lagrangian reduced cost) for solving unicost SCPs.
