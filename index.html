<li>Chao Gao, Siqi Yan, Ryan Hayward, Martin Mueller. <a href="#">A transferable neural network for Hex</a> In Computer Games 2018. <strong>At 21st Computer Olympiad, our program MoHex3HNN based on three-head net and transfer learning (128 filters per layer, 10 residual blocks, iteratively trained on ~0.4 million self-play generated games) won 11x11 and 13x13 Hex tournaments against DeepEzo from Japan. DeepEzo was trained using minimax search based RL for several millions of games. Note that in comparison to MoHex3HNN and DeepEzo, previous champion program MoHex 2.0 is now a weak baseline.</strong> See report <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/papers/taiwan18.pdf">Hex 2018: MoHex3HNN over DeepEzo</a></li>
